# CNN for Hand-Based Binary Gender Classification

This repository contains the implementation of a convolutional neural network (CNN) system designed to classify gender based on hand images. 
Leveraging the LeNet and AlexNet architectures, the system focuses on hand morphology and texture, achieving high classification accuracy through preprocessing and model optimization.
The project was developed as part of the "Fundamentals of Data Science" course during the Master's degree in Computer Science at Sapienza University of Rome in the 2024/25 academic year.
